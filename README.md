## You probably want to use [`crates-index`][0]

This crate is a hard fork of [`crates-index`][0] to fit the use cases of [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) and [`cargo-fetcher`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-fetcher), if you are looking for a crate to access a cargo registry index, you would be well served by using [`crates-index`][0] instead.

## Differences from [`crates-index`][0]

If you still want to use this crate instead, there are some differences to be aware of. Though note any of these may change in the future as [`crates-index`][0] and this crate evolve.

1. Git registry support is optional, gated behind the `git` feature flag.
1. Git functionality is provided by [`gix`](https://crates.io/crates/gix) instead of [`git2`](https://crates.io/crates/git2)
1. The API exposes enough pieces where an alternative git implementation can be used if `gix` is not to your liking.
1. Sparse index support is optional, gated behind the `sparse` feature flag.
1. Sparse HTTP functionality is provided by the [`reqwest`](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate
1. Support for creating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP responses is still available when the `sparse` feature is not enabled if you want to use a different HTTP client than `reqwest`
1. Local cache files are always supported regardless of features enabled
1. Functionality for determining the local index location for a remote registry URL is exposed in the public API
1. Functionality for writing cache entries to the local index cache is exposed in the public API
